In this pandas project, my primary objective was to perform comprehensive data manipulation and analysis. including:
  1.Feature Engineering: I conducted in-depth feature engineering to enhance the dataset's information and improve its predictive power.
  2. Data Encoding: I employed advanced data encoding methods to transform categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
  3.Data Filtering: I strategically filtered and cleaned the data to ensure its quality and relevance for subsequent analysis.
  4.Bivariate Analysis: I explored relationships between pairs of variables to uncover important insights and correlations within the dataset.
  5.Univariate Analysis: I conducted a detailed examination of individual variables to better understand their characteristics and distributions.

To achieve these goals, I leveraged various pandas functions and methods, including but not limited to:
- unique ()
- map ()
- fillna ()
- isnull()
- describe ()
- shape()
- tail()
- sum ()
- mode()
- drop()
- info()
- head()

In addition to these pandas functionalities, I also created compelling data visualizations using Seaborn, including barplots and heatmaps, 
to effectively communicate key findings and patterns within the data.
This comprehensive approach ensured that the project not only met its objectives but also presented the results in a clear and visually appealing manner.
